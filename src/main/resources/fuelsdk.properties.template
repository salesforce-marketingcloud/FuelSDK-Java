#
# You can authenticate with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud either via
# OAuth client credentials (clientId/clientSecret) or user login
# credentials (username/password). Note that OAuth client credentials
# and user login credentials are mutually exclusive--if you specify
# clientId/clientSecret, username/password will be ignored. Also,
# if you specify username/password, you will only be able to access
# SFMC SOAP API objects, as the SFMC REST API requires OAuth
# based authentication. Finally, if you specify username/password,
# you must also specify the soapEndpoint property, as the
# SDK will be unable to automatically determine the SOAP endpoint.
#

#
# Configuration:
#

#
# true if the SDK should automatically hydrate objects that require
# multiple API calls, false otherwise. Note: If autoHydrateObjects
# is set to false, you will need to call the appropriate retrieve
# methods on objects that require multiple API calls to fully
# populate them. For example, with autoHydrateObjects set to true,
# you can simply do this to get the lists a subscriber is on:
#
#     ETSubscriber subscriber = client.retrieveObject(ETSubscriber.class,
#                                                     "key=[...]");
#     for (Subscription subscription : subscriber.getSubscriptions()) {
#         // [...]
#     }
#
# If autoHydrateObjects is set to false, however, getSubscriptions()
# will return an empty list unless retrieveSubscriptions() is called
# first:
#
#     ETSubscriber subscriber = client.retrieveObject(ETSubscriber.class,
#                                                     "key=[...]");
#     subscriber.retrieveSubscriptions();
#     for (Subscription subscription : subscriber.getSubscriptions()) {
#         // [...]
#     }
#
# Note that retrieveSubscriptions() need not be called immediately
# before getSubscriptions().. For example, you could reduce the
# number of API calls by calling retrieveSubscriptions()
# manually if and when a subscriber's subscriptions are updated.
